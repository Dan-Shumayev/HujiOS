TODO - Answer theoretical questions, update partner's details, and add impl. description

Theoretical part - Q&A:

1. Q: Describe one general use of Linux pid namespaces.
   A: One general use of Linux pid namespaces is to define
      what of the kernel resources the processes in the linux
      container can see such as pid,user id, File system,etc.

2. Q: How can Linux mount namespaces be used to help isolate a process?
   A: Linux mount allows to each of the processes to hace different view
      of the system from the original one, which allows different root
      for each isolate process.

3. Q: Describe one general use of Linux Cgroups.
   A: Linux cgroups defines what container can do such:
      what is limit of usage on CPU, max processes to manage, memory use, etc.

4. Q: Explain the use of the clone command, and how it is different from the fork command
   A: Clone command is creating new process with specific set of attributes such
      as namespaces. the different btween these commands is that clone
      is upgraded command of fork beacuse its create child process and gives
      more precise control on the data shared between process and its child.

5. Q: What does the chroot command do?
   A: chroot command is changing the root directory path to given path, for
      current running process as for its child's ones.

6. Q: What is the purpose of procfs? Give an example of its use.
   A: The /proc file system is a mounted file system used to trace a process
      system calls, to receive signals and errors.
      An example of its uses is to obtain info about kernel and
      to change certain kernel params at runtime.
