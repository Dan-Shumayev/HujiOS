ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
If the program is supplied with 1 argument, creates the following directories(relative to CWD):
Welcome, Welcome/To
and creates the file Welcome/To/OS2020, to which it writes a message of the form:
{LINUX USER}, if you haven't read the guidelines yet, do it now...\n{ARGUMENT}
It then closes the file, deletes it and the directories that were created.

In case no argument was provided, it writes an error message to a
STDERR, and then exits with a success return code.
