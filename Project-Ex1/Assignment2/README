# Operating Systems - Exercise 1 

FILES:
README      - this file
MAKEFILE    - Makefile
osm.h       - header of our library
osm.cpp     - implementation of time measurement library
plot.png    - plot of average running time per on different machines 


- **Assignment 1**: In general, the binary creates two directories and a file iff:
1. it detects that there is an environment variable of `USER` **AND**
2. it indeed has received one argument.
==> The directories are `Welcome`/`To`; And a file named `OS2021` which contains the sentence:
`$(USER)/nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!/n<The argument passed>`.
Eventually, the program removes the file and those two directories.

=======

- **Assignment 2:** Well-documeneted within the source file.
