# Operating Systems - Exercise 1 

- **Assignment 1**: In general, the binary creates two directories and a file - if it detects that there is an environment variable of `USER` **AND** it indeed has received one argument. The directories are `Welcome`/`To`; And a file named `OS2021` which contains the sentence: `$(USER)/nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!/n<The argument passed>`. Eventually, the program removes the file and those two directories.
